# hoist
A tracking app I built for myself that follows the n-sun's 5-day weightlifting program (row variant). It has the following features:
- Quickly select the day of the week, then use the slider to pick the exercise you want to track.
- Enter your training maxes, and the app will automatically calculate the weights for all sets.
- For each set, the app also calculates the plates you need for that weight (assuming a standard 45 pound bar, and availability of 2.5, 5, 10, 25, 35 and 45 pound plates).
- Easily cross off sets as you work through your lifts by checking the checkbox.
- Quickly re-set the crossed off sets with the click of a button.
